# AngularJS Formula1Service

A Simple Angular JS App that demonstrates the use of
* Controllers
* Services
* and Routes


Steps to Execute
------------------

npm install

npm start

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

npm test

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

npm run test-single-run
